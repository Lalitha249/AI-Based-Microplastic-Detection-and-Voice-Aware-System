# AI-Based-Microplastic-Detection-and-Voice-Aware-System

Microplastic pollution in drinking water has recently become a critical concern for environmental safety and human health. 
The presence of these tiny plastic particles in water supplies poses serious risks, necessitating accurate, rapid, and accessible detection methods.
This project focuses on developing an automated microplastic detection system using advanced deep learning techniques. The core of this system is a convolutional neural network (CNN) model trained to identify and locate microplastics in images of water samples. 
A simple and intuitive frontend, built using Streamlit, allows users to upload water images or capture them in real- time through a webcam. 
Upon image submission, the backend processes the image through the deep learning model, highlighting detected microplastic particles with bounding boxes and providing a clear message indicating whether the water is safe for consumption. 
Additionally, a voice alert functionality verbally notifies the user of the waterâ€™s safety status. 
This integrated approach combines computer vision, machine learning, and user-friendly interface design to create a practical tool for real-world water quality assessment. 
The project aims to offer a low-cost, fast, and scalable solution, contributing to public health protection and environmental monitoring efforts. 
Future enhancements will focus on improving detection accuracy, expanding contaminant coverage, and deploying the system in broader monitoring frameworks.
